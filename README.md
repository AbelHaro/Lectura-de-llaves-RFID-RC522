This project involves developing an access control system using RFID technology (RFID-RC522
reader). The system will allow user registration and access control using RFID keys and cards. To
switch the reader mode between registration and access, Bluetooth communication will be used. Registered users and accesses will be stored in a database accessible via a REST API within a container. For
visualization, Ubidots will be used. The entire project is available in a GitHub repository RFID-RC522
Key Reading.
